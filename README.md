Welcome to My Portfolio!

This is my personal portfolio created using HTML5 and CSS3. It showcases my experience, as well as a bit about my hobbies. I chose my favorite color, turquoise, as the theme of the portfolio. The site includes four pages: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact. On the About Me page, there is also a short video where I provide more information about my past experiences.

My protfolio has three viewport dimesions:
Laptop (width > 900px): The introduction video is displayed side-by-side with text for best viewing. Navigation links are placed horizontally, and headings and images are larger to enhance readability.

Tablet (width 651px â€“ 900px): Tablets have smaller screens, so the layout adjusts with content side-by-side but stacked vertically where needed. Text size is slightly reduced, and videos and images are resized to fit the screen appropriately.

Phone / Mobile (width â‰¤ 650px): For smaller devices, all sections are stacked vertically. Navigation links are stacked, fonts are scaled down, and buttons and input fields are wide enough for easy usability.

I have uesed liner gradiens for buttones in my protfolio. The gradiens range from 90deg, #3bb89e, #6496d6. This gradient flows from turquoise to blue at 90 degrees, creating a modern and aesthetic look. Hovering over buttons produces a subtle visual effect. Using my favorite colors makes the site feel personal and engaging.

The color scheme is personalized with turquoise and blue tones, set against a black background with a subtle checker pattern. This combination makes the portfolio unique, visually appealing, and fun both for me to create and for others to explore.

To make the website I refrenced the following videoes for ideas on what to add and how to structe. I didnt take any code from the soures, but willl add links of videos i got ideas from:
